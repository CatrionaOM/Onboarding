## Supervision

::: {.r-fit-text}

- Weekly lab meetings
  - Presence expected 
  - Presentations
  - Occasion to touch base
  - Take notes during discussions
- Group chat (discord, ...)
- Send emails / messages whenever, but don’t expect an immediate answer
- Feedback style
  - Not a lot of positive reinforcement <sub><sup>*(I'm working on it)*</sup></sub>
  - A lot of corrections doesn't mean it's bad
  - I have a tendency to rewrite code

## Be Collaborative

::::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.r-fit-text}

- Teamwork 
  - Lab mates are your best resource
- Good grades are not at the expense of others
  - Helping others will be noticed and will benefit you
- Acknowledge those who helped you 
  - Research is *not* a zero-sum game
  - Give credit where credit is due

## Be Open

- Independent intellectually does not mean all-knowing
- [Seek help]{.fragment .highlight-red} 
- Be transparent

## To-do

- Onboarding (https://github.com/RealityBending/Onboarding)
  - [x] GitHub basics
  - [x] Add your profile on the lab website


## Conventions

- No spaces or weird characters in folder and file names
  - [`c'est mon mémoire!.docx`]{.fragment .strike} 
  - `PreregDraft_Makowski.docx`
- *CamelCase* vs. *snake_case*
  - Also applies to programming
