## Supervision

::: {.r-fit-text}

- Weekly lab meetings
  - Presence expected 
  - Presentations
  - Occasion to touch base
- Group chat (discord, ...)
- Send emails / messages whenever, but donâ€™t expect an immediate answer
- Feedback style
  - Rare compliments
  - I have a tendency to rewrite code
  - A lot of corrections doesn't mean it's bad

:::

## Be Collaborative

::::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- Teamwork 
  - Lab mates are your best resource
- Good grades are not at the expense of others
  - Helping others will be noticed and will benefit you
- Acknowledge those who helped you
  - Give credit where credit is due
